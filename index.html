      <div class="motivation-statement">
        This is my main motivator and my strongest belief.<br />
        This time of turbulence is the time to secure a bright future and partake in the creation of better and more just world.<br />
        <br />
        In today's world, information is the new currency.<br />
        By using information in the most practical way one can achieve the highest return.<br />
        So, in today's modern world all you need is right information and the knowledge on how to use it.<br />
        <br />
        Therefore, that is what I do - I'm gathering all the knowledge I can, trying to think systematically about it to organize it in the most useful way and than use it.<br />
        Use it in the areas that are of interest to me and that make my curiosity go haywire - Law, Business, Hacking, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, Robotics and Biohacking.<br />
        Then upgrade it - use it practically. Using the technology, knowledge of law and finance to create new and improved agricultural methods, by focusing on the processes that string my heart -
        beer brewing, wine making and olive oil making.<br />
        And, in the end, on the success of that undertaking create the hacienda on Krk and ranch in Lika through which we will provide ultimate and exclusive tourist service.

      Basic Info (or what am I good at...)

      The Art of
      INFORMATION GATHERING
      I possess fundamental need to understand how things and processes work. That trait always forces me to find new problem. The aforementioned need and trait developed in me a certain
      „hacking mindset“ that forces me to follow various information and the ability to efficiently distil useful information from unnecessary ones.

      The Critical skill of
      INFORMATION ANALYSIS
      The value of information is based on its causal impact to its immediate environment. My deep analytical skills help me notice and understand the cause-and-effect relationships in the environment
      as well as the various complexities that exist in the environment and are able to influence the other subjects.

      The Fine Nuance of
      STORYTELLING
      The real value of information lies in the outcome(s) it produces. To that end, my creativity lets me make various predictions on to which effect(s) can some event cause. It requires a decent degree
       of imagination, an affection for the out-of-the-box thinking and a courage to follow the predictions to some dark places where they could lead.

      The Endless Possibility of
      INTERACTION DESIGN
      My interest in many fields has helped me to stay curious, open and flexible. It made me proficient in utilising originality to make various concepts through combination of various social, nature
       and science areas and create prototypes of even most complex ideas.

      The Virtue of
      PURPOSEFULNESS
      As stated, I start each journey by following information through the rabbit hole to find the problem, and finish it by establishing at least one appropriate solution. However, value is created
       only by intelligent utilization of solution, by finding its most useful purpose. I achieve this through my presentation skills, advanced use of Internet and various forms of networking.

       The Principle of
       SUSTAINABILITY
       There must be only one principle for the use of obtained and created information and products – do no evil – to people, to societies, to humanity, to Nature, to Earth.
